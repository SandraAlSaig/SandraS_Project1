        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring Front-End Web Developer.<br />
            My background is Hungarian-Palestinian in origin,but thanks to living in such a small world I was lucky to travel around, visit and live in many other beautiful countries including the amazing Netherlands which will always be my favorite :).</p>
            <p>For the past 3 years I've been living in London,and after plenty of office positions and many career path ideas, I've decided to pursue becoming a Web Developer.</p>
            <p>I've always enjoyed being creative and organising,which makes Front-End web developing the perfoct path for me. I’m definitely excited to bring my life experience into the process of building fantastic looking websites.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to master the process of building web sites and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Bootstrap</li>
          <li>Ajax</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I’d like to work for a web design firm helping clients create an impressive online presence.</p>
        <p>In the longterm I want to solve frontend problems for new platforms as they arise ( VR, AR, voice, motion, IOT, etc ).</p>
        <p>I want to work on creative projects, and I always want to be honing my craft. <br />To learn new things every day and to write exceptional code..</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I have plenty of hobbies to do when I'm not trying to debug a new code I wrote :)<br />
        I speak 4 languages fluently and I do think it is one of the hobbies that started out as an obligation but still looking to learn one more. </p>
        <p>Originally I was a professional make-up artist and hairdresser and with that said,I'm all for creativity..so I also enjoy baking cakes and muffins and love to cook in general.</p>
        <p>But above all..... I'm a huge geek when it comes to Game of Thrones and the Marvel Universe.I adore everything from comics/books to movies.</p>
